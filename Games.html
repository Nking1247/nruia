                    &emsp; My First Fully Developed App! Rush Rider is now available on the App Store and the Play Store. Rush Rider 
                    is an endless runner like no other. The player swerves through traffic cones and cars on a bicycle. He is provided with
                    full range of motion, but be careful! He is prone to tipping over if he leans too much. He can collect coins along the way to buy
                    different bikes and outifts. Choose between City mode and Mountain mode.

                    &emsp; Sticky Hands is a VR Game made for the Oculus Quest. You play as Jeff. Jeff is very bored at his office today and needs to find something to do. Luckily, he was at the arcade yesterday
                    and won a sticky hand toy! Control Jeff and cause as much chaos as you can. This is the first VR game that I have ever made which meant that I faced a lot of challenges. It took me 2 days just to get VR controls to work in 
                    our game. In addition, the sticky hand was not easy to make as we wanted it to feel realistic but also easy to use. By taking full advantage of the joint system in Unity, I was able to create a sticky hand
                    which emulated the stickiness and elasticity of a real life sticky hand. However, this was very complicated to aim and therefore did not make an easy to play game. Therefore, I worked for days in order to create what I call fake physics. The first iterations tried
                    to guess where the player wanted the sticky hand to be by taking in variables such as where the player was looking, how fast the player's hand was moving, and possible objects in the sticky hand's path. While this worked, we found it to be more intuitive to use a button which
                    would shoot out the sticky hand in the direction of the player's hand. I am very proud of this game and cannot believe what I was able to accomplish in 1 week.

                        &emsp; We were tasked with recreating Tempest, a thrilling 3D arcade game from 1981. After doing some research, we found that the creator of Tempest, Dave Theurer, was inspired by a nightmare he had of monsters crawling up a hole. 
                        We decided to bring his vision to life in our recreation. The game was revolutionary for being one of the first faux 3D games. We decided to keep this style of art by using 2D sprites with a 3D perspective to create a unique looking
                        style that stays true to the original. In addition, Tempest was the first to have a level select system. For this reason, we created multiple levels with smooth transitions and my code is completely modular so it is easy to create new levels. Finally, Tempest was the first
                        to use Vector graphics. For this reason, we decided to up the graphics in our recreation. I did this by learning post-processing and adding it to the game.

                        leaps across death defying chasms. Careful of the cross bows aimed at Tommy's head, and 
                        make sure you don't get swept away in the massive tidal wave! This 2D platformer was made 
                        in honor of my school's mascot. It includes multiple levels and several types of obstacles 
                        to avoid. In this project I first learned how to animate.

                        and they are looking for blood. Escape to the portal at the end of each level. This game features a boss at the end, King Insect.
